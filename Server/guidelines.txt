Research Paper Quality Evaluation Guidelines
Based on "How to Rate the Quality of a Research Paper: Introducing a Helpful Algorithm for Architects and Designers"
Background and Purpose
The critical appraisal of evidence presented in research papers is an essential step in evidence-based design (EBD), which aims to transfer research findings into design practice. These guidelines provide a systematic method to evaluate research paper quality, particularly targeted for those without extensive training in research methodology.

The Evidence-Based Design Process
The EBD process follows a six-step circular approach:

Define the research question and develop a research strategy
Acquire and select relevant papers
Critically appraise the quality of research studies
Weigh the evidence by combining results from multiple studies
Develop design recommendations (scaled from weak to strong)
Implement and evaluate design decisions
This guideline focuses specifically on step 3: critically appraising the quality of individual research studies.

Understanding Quality of Evidence
Quality of evidence is defined as "the extent to which a study's design, conduct, and analysis has minimized selection, measurement, and confounding bias." The better a study protects against bias and error, the higher the quality of the results produced.

Key methods to protect against bias include:

Group allocation: Dividing participants into treatment and control groups
Randomization: Random allocation of participants to groups
Blinding: Neither participants nor researchers know which group a participant belongs to (double-blind)
Hierarchical Levels of Evidence
For classification of research studies, hierarchical levels of evidence have been established. These indicate the confidence given to the validity of results.

Evidence Levels for Research Papers
Level 1

Systematic reviews of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or nonrandomized studies
Meta-analysis of multiple experimental or quasi-experimental studies
Meta-synthesis of multiple qualitative studies leading to an integrative interpretation
Level 2

Well-designed experimental (randomized) studies
Well-designed quasi-experimental (nonrandomized) studies
Both with consistent results compared to other, similar studies
Level 3

Observational studies
Well-designed qualitative studies
Integrative or systematic reviews of observational or qualitative studies
RCT or quasi-experimental studies with inconsistent results compared to other, similar studies
Level 4

Professional standards or guidelines with studies to support recommendations
Level 5

Opinions of recognized experts
Case studies
Level 6

Recommendations from manufacturers or consultants who may have a financial interest or bias
Algorithm for Rating Evidence Quality
This algorithm guides users through a flow chart to determine study design and assign the appropriate evidence level. There are two main flow charts depending on the nature of the study.

Initial Decision: Choose the Correct Flow Chart
Start by answering: "Was a singular study or measurement conducted?"

If YES: Use Flow Chart 1 (for papers based on investigations)
If NO: Use Flow Chart 2 (for papers based on multiple investigations, such as reviews)
Flow Chart 1: Algorithm for Studies Based on a Singular Investigation
Question 1: "Did the investigator assign interventions or exposures?"
This determines whether the researcher actively modified anything (e.g., building features, lighting, floor covering).

If YES: The study is an experiment or quasi-experiment. Proceed to Question 1A.
If NO: The study is an observational or qualitative study. Proceed to Question 1B.
Question 1A: "Was the group allocation assigned randomly?"
If YES: The study is an experimental study (randomized controlled trial or RCT).
If well-conducted, assign Level 2; otherwise Level 3.
Criteria for "well-conducted":
Two separate groups (treatment and control)
Low attrition rate (<20%)
Intention-to-treat analysis
Consistent results
High quality of masked randomization
High quality of blinding
If NO: The study is a quasi-experimental study.
If well-conducted, assign Level 2; otherwise Level 3.
Criteria for "well-conducted":
Two separate groups (treatment and control) when possible
Low attrition rate (<20%)
Intention-to-treat analysis
Consistent results
Question 1B: "Was there a numerical or statistical analysis?"
If YES: The study is an observational study. Assign Level 3.
Types of observational studies:
Panel study: A sample followed over time, measuring effects of exposures
Cohort study: Comparing subsamples with different characteristics
Case-control study: Comparing individuals with and without a condition, looking backward for causes
Cross-sectional study: Observations at a single point in time to find correlations
If NO: The study is a qualitative study.
If the study is based on a literature review and conceptual framework, contains a report on information collection and analysis methods, and develops an account of different views while recognizing diversity: Assign Level 3.
Otherwise: Assign Level 5.
Flow Chart 2: Algorithm for Studies Based on Multiple Investigations
Question 2: "Is there a systematic approach?"
A systematic approach includes a literature review, clearly stated research objective, and a description of the process to gather comprehensive evidence.

If NO: The paper is non-systematic. Further classification needed:
Recommendations from manufacturers or consultants: Assign Level 6
Opinions of recognized experts: Assign Level 5
Professional organizational standards or guidelines with supporting studies: Assign Level 4
Professional organizational standards or guidelines without supporting studies: Assign Level 5
If YES: The paper is a systematic review, meta-analysis, meta-synthesis, or integrative review. Proceed to Question 2A.
Question 2A: "Does the paper offer a meta-analysis or meta-synthesis of the reviewed paper's results?"
If YES: Assign Level 1
If NO: Proceed to Question 2B
Question 2B: "Does the review include studies with experimental or quasi-experimental design?"
If YES: Assign Level 1
If NO: Assign Level 3
Special Case: Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE)
Post-Occupancy Evaluations often employ mixed methods from observational and qualitative studies.

Determine which method or study design is used predominantly
Or classify evidence from different parts separately
Examples:
Numerical data analysis on residents' use of hallways: Level 3 (observational)
Focus group content: Level 3 or 5 depending on quality (qualitative)
Application Guidelines for Quality Assessment
When evaluating a research paper:

Determine if the paper describes a singular study or is based on multiple studies
Follow the appropriate flow chart based on the study type
Answer the questions in sequence to identify the study design
Apply the criteria to assign the correct evidence level
Consider whether the study is well-conducted according to the specific criteria
For mixed method studies, evaluate each component separately
Weighing Evidence After Quality Assessment
After determining the quality level of individual studies, the next step is to weigh the evidence by:

Combining results from several studies on the chosen research question
Considering external factors such as evidence consistency, relevance, and external validity
Developing scaled design recommendations (weak to strong) based on quality and weight
Implementing and evaluating design decisions
Quantitative vs. Qualitative Assessment
When evaluating papers, identify:

Whether the study is quantitative (using numerical or statistical analysis) or qualitative (interpretative classification)
The source of data (interviews, questionnaires, observations, measurements)
The methodology used (experimental, observational, case study)
Sample sizes and randomization procedures
Whether conclusions are supported by the evidence presented
Practical Evaluation Steps
Read the paper's methodology section carefully
Identify the type of study using the flow charts
Assess whether the methodology is appropriate for the research question
Check if the study meets the criteria for being well-conducted
Assign the evidence level
Note strengths and limitations of the study design
Consider how the evidence might be applied in practice
Comparing Evidence Across Studies
When comparing multiple papers on the same topic:

Rank the papers by evidence level (Level 1 being highest quality)
For papers with the same level, compare based on sample size, methodological rigor, and applicability
Consider doing pair comparisons when evaluating multiple papers
Identify consistencies and contradictions in findings
Give greater weight to higher-quality evidence
